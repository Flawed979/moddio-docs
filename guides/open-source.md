# Open Source Games

Another resource for learning how to build your own games is by looking at open-source games. Moddio creators can make their game open-source so that anyone can view the scripts and make forks of their games. If you see a feature you like in a game, this allows you to see how that creator built it.

You can check out open-source game code by doing the following:
* Click on the **Search** bar on the Home screen
* Hit ``Enter``with the empty Search bar to view all games
* Click the toggle for **Open Source Games**
* Click on any game to enter
* Click on the **Menu** button in the upper left corner of the game
* Select **Inspect Game Code** from the options

You will now see the Game Editor show up on your game screen. Just like if you were editing your own game, you will be able to click on the **Entities** workspace and see all the Scripts in the game. This can help you learn how to build features from some of your favorite games!
