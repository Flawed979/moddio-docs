# Attributes

*This page needs help. Find out how to contribute [here](../../how-to-contribute.md)*

An entity type can have variables of many different types, but there is also an option for more specific and powerful variables. These **Attributes** are more specific in that they are only ```Number``` (or ```Time```) types, and more powerful because the engine has built-in calculations and rendering options that do not exist for variables.
