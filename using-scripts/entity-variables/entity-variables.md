# Entity Variables

*This page needs help. Find out how to contribute [here](../../README.md)*

Entity variables are variables that belong to a specific entity, not to be confused with player variables. **[link text to Player Variables page]** Entity variables can only be used in the scope of that entity's scripts. Don't confuse these with player variables, which are different.

**general purpose entity-variables page**

**maybe combine with Player Variables page?**
