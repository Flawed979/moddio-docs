# Interface

The core Moddio interface is the same no matter which template you use. After you go to Moddio, go to **Create** to make a new game. Then, click the **Create a new game** button, and select your template. YOu will then enter the game and load the game editor. 

By default, you will enter Moddio in Play mode. However, as owner of the game, you will have several UI options that are not available to players. At the top of the game screen, you will see a navigation bar in the center of your window. The bar consists of Editor, Play, Map, Entities, Moderate, Report, and the Publish/Republish button.

While we will go more in-depth of each button later. The primary workspaces are as follows:
*   **Editor**
    *   This drop-down menu presents options to Export and Import JSON and access Settings. In addition, users can access the legacy sandbox by navigating to this drop down menu.

*   **Map**
    *   This workspace gives access to map editing tools. The Map Editor currently includes the Cursor, Region, Stamp Brush, Eraser, and Bucket tools along with two brush sizes and layer selection. The Palette below is sourced from the Settings of the game and presents all tiles available in the currently selected tilesheet to build the map.

*   **Entities**
    *   Entities are organized into World, Units, Items, and Projectiles sections. In this interface, you will be able to edit the properties, scripts, and cellsheets of anything generated in your game. In addition, this workspace allows you to add additional Entities into the game and script each one individually. This is where the majority of creating and building your game occurs.

*   **Report**
    *   You'll see this window split into tabs for Overview, Server Logs, Server Crash, Coin Report, and Cohort analysis. This allows you to view data about your game's performance and stats. You'll also see how many coins you've earned from the game.
