# How to report issues

If you're experiencing technical issues while playing games on Moddio or using the editor, please report your issue in our [Forum](https://www.modd.io/forum/). If you think the issue can be better communicated via chat, please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XRe8T7K) and post your findings on #Bug-Report channel.

## Reporting performance issues

If your game is not running properly. For example, lagging, low-fps, or objects not rendering properly, please provide as much information as possible when reporting issue.

The information that will help us:
- Your device (PC, Mac, Chromebook, Android, iPhone, etc)
- The browser you're using (Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc)
- Relevant screenshots

If the issue's related with performance, please run a profiler and provide us with the profiler export JSON file. Here how you can do this:
1. Press F12 to open Chrome's developer tool. It looks something like this
