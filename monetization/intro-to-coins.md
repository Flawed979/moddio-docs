# Introduction to Modd Coins

## Monetization with Modd Coins

Modd Coins are our in-game currency, and you can use them to monetize your games. You can add skins, items, ads, and more for purchase in your games, and cash out your Modd Coins for real money. Here's how it works:

- Modd Coins for Cash: You earn coins for every transaction within your game, and Moddio takes a 10% transaction fee. You can convert your Modd Coins directly into real money, with a minimum payout amount of $20. Payments are currently made via Paypal, with more payment options coming soon.
- Using Modd Coins in Your Games: Modd Coins are a great way to offer in-game skins and items and make your game more fun and engaging over the long term. You decide how much skins or items sell for, or you can add coin prizes as a way to incentivize players.
- Allow Ads in Your Games: You can add video ads into your games and earn coins. You can specify when theyâ€™re shown to players in order to provide the best experience - for example, in between game rounds. This provides another avenue to monetize your games without your players spending money.

Modd Coins provide a way to generate income from your creativity and hard work, enriching your game development journey on Moddio.

Remember, these resources and opportunities are created for you. We encourage you to utilize them to enhance your game development skills, contribute to our vibrant Moddio community and create entertaining games that players around the world can enjoy. We look forward to seeing what you create!
