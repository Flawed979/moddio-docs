## Moddio Game Creation Platform: Guidelines for Modd Coins Use and Game Design

1. **Responsible Ad Usage:** Ads should contribute to gameplay experience rather than disrupt it. Excessive ad play or use of bots to play ads is strictly prohibited. A creator found abusing this system will be penalized.

2. **No Gambling-Like Games:** Games designed to mimic or encourage gambling are forbidden. This includes games that primarily rely on chance, rather than skill, and use Modd Coins as stakes.

3. **In-Game Items:** In-game items should be fairly priced and not solely aimed at Modd Coin generation. Items must add value to the gameplay, not just to the creatorâ€™s coin balance. 

4. **No Automated Scripts or Bots:** The use of bots, scripts, or any automated methods to gain an unfair advantage, including coin farming, is strictly prohibited. 

5. **Fair Play:** Games should be designed to offer genuine entertainment and value to players. Those created solely for Modd Coin generation will be reviewed and may be removed.

6. **Moderation:** Moddio reserves the right to review and remove any games that we deem to be violating these guidelines. Persistent abuse may result in the creator's account being banned.

7. **Continuous Improvement:** These guidelines are subject to change as we continue to refine and improve our platform. We encourage creators to regularly review them and ensure compliance. 

8. **Payout Requests:** Moddio reserves the right to withhold or refuse payout for any reason, particularly in instances of perceived abuse or violation of these guidelines. This is to protect the integrity of our platform, uphold fair play, and deter the misuse of Modd Coins.

Remember, the purpose of coins is to reward creators for making games that are fun and foster a community of creativity. Thank you for your cooperation.
