## Welcome to the Dev Mode!

We are working on this new and improved editor to replace the old sandbox. One of our goals has been to turn Moddio game development into a multiplayer experience.

In this version you'll be able to:
\* edit maps live with friends
\* work on scripts and game code in a shared environment

Features we're still working on:
\* better UI and more tools for map editing
\* improving the window manager performance
\* adding functionality that's missing from old sandbox
\* smoother republishes

Since the new editor is in active development, we suggest you **make frequent backups** of your game.json while working in it. To make a backup, click Menu, then select 'Export JSON'. You can import the json from the /sandbox menu.

### General Usage:

The top bar allows you to switch between **4 different workspaces**:

*   Map Editor: you can edit the map here. Gives you access to a tool switcher, a layer selector and a tile picker.

*   Entities: allows you to inspect and edit scripts, Most changes here require a republish to take effect.

*   Moderate: use this to ban/kick/mute players.

*   Debug: allows you to inspect the games variables and performance

The menu dropdown on the left gives access to the game settings and allows you to make a backup.

### Map Editor:

In the Map Editor workspace you'll see:

*   a **layer toggle** in the bottom right. You can switch layers here by clicking on the layer of your choice. You are always working on the selected layers and will draw/remove tiles from there.

*   a **tile picker** that you can toggle by clicking on it or pressing the tab key. When expanded, you can select tiles to draw with from here.

*   **tools and size buttons**.
    *   the **brush** is your basic tool and selected by default. It allows you to place your current tile selection on the Map with **Left Click**.

    *   the **cursor tool** allows you to use weapons and item instead of drawing tiles.

    *   the **eraser tool** erases your current tile selection. Useful for removing tiles.

    *   the **1x1** and **2x2** tools change the size of your brush.

Right clicking on the map copies the tiles you're currently pointing to (even empty tiles). Using this you can
