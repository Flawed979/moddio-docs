# Getting Started with Moddio: A Guide for Developers

Welcome to Moddio, the premier 2D game development platform! These Docs are designed to get you started on your path to creating interactive, engaging multiplayer games.

## Understanding Moddio as a Game Development Platform

Moddio is more than a game development platform. It's a thriving community of creators and players who share a passion for gaming. Our mission is to make game development accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. With Moddio's versatile game editor, you can bring your vision to life, whether it's educational games, action-packed adventures, or immersive RPGs.

## Getting Started with Game Development

Here are your first steps to making a game:

1. Create a Moddio Account: Visit www.modd.io and sign up for a free account.
2. Access the Moddio Editor: Go to the **Create** tab at the top to get started building. As a browser-based platform, there's no need to download anything! Once you're logged in, you can directly access the editor and start creating. 
3. Choose a Template or Start from Scratch: Moddio offers a variety of templates to help you get started. If you prefer, you can also start from scratch using the **Open World** template, and let your creativity run wild. Make sure you check out our **Guided Tutorial** to understand the editor and make your first guided game (or visit the [First Game page](../first-game/making-first-game.md)) - we'll take you step-by-step through the process.
4. Explore the Workspaces: Familiarize yourself with the Play, Map, Entities, and Report workspaces. Understand their functions and the tools available in each. (Check out our [Interface overview](interface.md) for more)
5. Start Creating: Start with simple tasks like designing a map or creating an entity, and then gradually move on to more complex tasks such as scripting game mechanics.

Remember, game development is an iterative process, and Moddio and our community are here to support you every step of the way.

## Game Editor Overview

Moddio game development is meant to be a multiplayer experience so that it's fun and collaborative to make a game.

With this editor, you'll be able to:
* Edit maps live with friends
* Work on scripts and game code in a shared environment

Since the editor is in active development, we suggest you **make frequent backups** of your `game.json` while working in it. To make a backup, click **Editor**, then select 'Export JSON'. You can import the JSON at any time, also through the Editor section.

### General Usage:

The top bar allows you to switch between **4 different workspaces** (A more in-depth description of each can be found in [Interface](interface.md))

*   Editor: You can access setting and export/import JSON files

*   Map: You can edit the map here. You have access to tools, a layer selector and a tile picker.

*   Entities: Allows you to inspect and edit scripts. Most changes here require a republish to take effect.

*   Report: Allows you to inspect performance reports and server issues.

The Hamburger Menu dropdown in the upper left corner gives you access to the general information about your game and game settings.

## Tips for Designing Games

Here are some tips to help you when designing your games:

- **Understand Your Audience**: Knowing who your game is intended for will guide your game design. Consider things like your audience's age, interests, and preferences.
- **Balance Engagement and Challenge**: Successful games need to be both engaging and challenging. They should captivate your player's interest and offer enough difficulty to keep them engaged.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Regularly test your game and seek feedback from players. Use this feedback to improve your game's quality and make it more fun.
- **Collaborate and Learn**: Moddio is not just a platform, but a community. Engage with other game creators, seek help when needed, and exchange ideas. This will not only improve your own game but also help make our community more fun and rewarding.
