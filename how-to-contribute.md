We are always looking for more help from the community. PRs are always welcome.

# Documentation Contribution

To contribute in documentation, please read the instructions on how to load documentation locally [here](/README.md)
Then, run documentation locally and make changes as you deem necessary.

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, create a PR in our [github repo](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs), and someone from our core team will review.

We strongly recommend you to familarize yourself with Moddio Game Editor which can be accessed on [modd.io](https://www.modd.io).
