# We need contributors, and we are also hiring

First, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XRe8T7K) :mechanical_arm:

## Game Engine Contribution

  Our Game Engine, [Taro Engine](https://github.com/moddio/taro2) is completely free and open source under the MIT license. We are always looking for more help from the community. PR's are always welcomed.

## Documentation Contribution

We use [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) as a framework for our docs.

For local development and testing, it is best to use the `docsify-cli` package, which allows you to easily view changes on `localhost:3000`. The following example uses `npm` with the `-g` flag for a global install from the command line.

```sh
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

To run our doc locally, clone [our repo](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs) and typing below inside moddio-docs/ folder:

```sh
docsify serve
```

While this server is running, you can view the docs locally by navigating to `localhost:3000` on your web browser. There is no need to restart the docsify server. The changes will reflect after saving the files.

Once you make modifications, please submit your PR, and someone from our core team will review.
